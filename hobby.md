I am working on a web-based digital humanities / media archaeology project tentatively titled "Making Tetris,"
which will be comprised of:

* My research into the unofficial development history and design evolution of Tetris;
* A curated, "haunted graveyard" of over 1,000 unauthorized PC clones of Tetris, playable in modern computer emulators;
* An introductory "Code your own Tetris" tutorial using a block-based programming environment to make customizable
Tetris-like variations; and
* a syllabus and lesson plan for a college-level interdisciplinary digital media course
in which students will design and build their own Tetris-like games using conventional game development tools.

## Romhacking (1998-2001)

Under the alias "necrosaro" I worked on a variety of ROM hacking and fan translation [projects](http://www.romhacking.net/community/177/), which were some of my earliest open-source technical productions.

See also my more recent academic writing for a more theoretical perspective on this community: ["From Rule-Breaking to ROM-Hacking: Theorizing the Computer Game-as-Commodity."](http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/07311.20061.pdf) Situated Play, Proceedings of DiGRA 2007 Conference.
