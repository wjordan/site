I am working on a web-based digital humanities / media archaeology project tentatively titled "Hack Tetris,"
which will be comprised of my research into the unofficial development history and design evolution of Tetris,
a curated "haunted graveyard" of over 1,000 unauthorized PC clones of Tetris playable in modern computer emulators,
an introductory "Code your own Tetris" tutorial using a block-based programming environment to make customizable
Tetris-like variations, and a syllabus and lesson plan for a college-level interdisciplinary digital media course
in which students will design and build their own Tetris-like games using conventional game development tools.
