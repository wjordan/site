<h1>Work</h1>

<h1><a href="https://fly.io">Fly.io</a></h1>
<h3>October 2021-November 2025</h3>
<p><a href="https://fly.io">Fly.io</a> is a cloud computing platform that runs applications close to users by deploying them on hardware around the world. As a software engineer I worked on SRE and general infrastructure platform development and operations. In 2022 I authored <a href="https://fly.io/blog/the-serverless-server/">"The Serverless Server"</a>, a technical analysis of AWS Lambda with an eye towards the potential of future serverless products.

<h1><a href="https://code.org">Code.org</a></h1>
<h3>March 2014-September 2021</h3>
<p>Launched in 2013, Code.org is a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. I joined Code.org in March 2014 as part of their ~10-person engineering team. In addition to my work on Code Studio, I contribute to various aspects of our web technology infrastructure, teacher professional development organization, and volunteer efforts with industry partners.

<h2>Code Studio</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNIM1fzJ8u0"><img src="/images/rNIM1fzJ8u0.jpg" alt="Code Studio video"></a>
<p><a href="https://studio.code.org">Code Studio</a> is an <a href="https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org">open-source</a>, web-based series of kid-friendly computer-science lessons designed to be used in classroom settings. Our latest <a href="https://code.org/educate/k5">K-5 program</a> containing three 20-hour courses for elementary students was developed over Summer 2014 and <a href="http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/97219291088/announcing-code-studio">launched</a> in September 2014. I worked closely with our education and engineering teams and several level-editing interns, developing the content-creation tools used to author this new curriculum. Code Studio currently reaches over 1.2 million students per month as of October 2014, with the new K-5 curriculum reaching over 300 thousand students in its first month since release.

<h1>ZipZapPlay/PopCap San Francisco</h1>
<h3>September 2010-September 2012</h3>
<p>ZipZapPlay was a independent social games startup, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2014/http://www.insidesocialgames.com/2011/04/29/popcap-acquires-baking-life-dev-zipzapplay-sunsets-happy-habitat-ahead-of-new-release/">acquired by PopCap</a> to become their San Francisco office in April 2011, just months before PopCap's own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2014/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/13/us-electronicarts-idUSTRE76B7FK20110713">acquisition by Electronic Arts</a> in July 2011. In addition to working on Baking Life and PvZ: Adventures, I participated in several of PopCap's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2014/http://blog.popcap.com/2011/09/22/welcome-to-popcamp/">"PopCamp"</a> week-long prototyping sessions.

<h2>Plants vs. Zombies: Adventures</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75m1oEdh_Vc"><img src="/images/75m1oEdh_Vc.jpg" alt="Plants vs. Zombies: Adventures video"></a>
<p>I worked on the Facebook game, <a href="http://www.popcap.com/plants-vs-zombies-adventures">Plants vs. Zombies: Adventures</a>, from its initial prototyping phase in July 2011 until mid-production in September 2012. I designed and implemented the game's data-driven, component-oriented game architecture, and the creation of an optimized 2D rendering engine featuring <a href="http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/gamedev-glossary-what-is-blitting--gamedev-2247">blitting</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2014/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/actionscript_blitting.html">techniques</a> and a <a href="http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-use-quadtrees-to-detect-likely-collisions-in-2d-space--gamedev-374">quadtree</a>-based dirty rectangle algorithm that vastly outperformed the Flash Platform's proprietary 2D engine, enabling the game to feature many high-quality animated objects on screen. The game was <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/20/call-in-sick-plants-vs-zombies-adventures-is-out-now/">released in May 2013</a>, reaching an audience of over 8 million monthly active users in August 2013, and was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2015/http://www.insidesocialgames.com/2014/07/24/ea-announces-closure-of-plants-vs-zombies-adventures-on-facebook/">shut down in October 2014</a>.

<h2>Baking Life</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSFrW_TXG_w"><img src="/images/SSFrW_TXG_w.jpg" alt="Baking Life video"></a>
<p>I worked on the Facebook game, Baking Life, from shortly after its initial launch in May 2010 through its shutdown in January 2012. Working as a contractor in Summer 2010, I implemented Facebook <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2014/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/sharing">Sharing</a> features that directly contributed to the game's viral growth, on its way to becoming a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2014/http://www.insidesocialgames.com/2010/09/01/top-25-facebook-games-for-september-2010-new-social-games-rising-as-older-ones-fall/">top 25 facebook game</a> with over 6 million monthly active users.
<p>After joining the company full-time in September 2010, I worked closely with the company's producers, artists and game designers implementing feature updates and new game mechanics including a messaging center that integrated with Facebook <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/requests">Requests</a>. I also heavily optimized the rendering engine, implementing a bitmap caching algorithm that vastly increased the game's performance on memory-constrained devices.
