I am working on a web-based digital humanities / media archaeology project tentatively titled "Making Tetris,"
which will be comprised of:

* My research into the unofficial development history and design evolution of Tetris;
* A curated "haunted graveyard" of over 1,000 unauthorized PC clones of Tetris playable in modern computer emulators;
* An introductory "Code your own Tetris" tutorial using a block-based programming environment to make customizable
Tetris-like variations; and
* a syllabus and lesson plan for a college-level interdisciplinary digital media course
in which students will design and build their own Tetris-like games using conventional game development tools.

## Technical Goals

* Open Web access: Integrate open-source emulators capable of emulating historical computing platforms through the modern, open web platform.
